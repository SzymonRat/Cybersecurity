Asset management establishes an organization’s inventory of high-value assets and defines how these assets
are managed during their lifecycle to ensure sustained productivity in support of the organization’s critical
services.  We can define four broad categories of assets: people, information, technology, and facilities. An
event that disrupts an asset can inhibit the organization from achieving its mission. An asset management
program helps identify appropriate strategies that will allow the assets to maintain productivity during
disruptive events.
The Asset Management domain focuses on the processes by which an organization plans, identifies,
documents, and manages the assets within the organization.
 Planning for asset management includes obtaining support from higher level management to ensure that the process is funded,
staffed, and performed. Key activities include identifying all the mission-critical services the organization
performs or provides and prioritizing them according to their potential to disrupt operations should they fail.
The organization can then focus its resources to appropriately protect and sustain its assets. Finally, planning
for asset management requires the organization to establish a common definition of what constitutes an asset
within its infrastructure. 

Important activities while planning for asset management:
• Obtain support for asset management planning.
• Identify services.
• Prioritize services.
• Establish a common definition of assets.


Important activities while identifying assets include the following: 
• Assign responsibility for identifying assets supporting critical services.
• Identify people assets.
• Identify information assets.
• Identify technology assets.
• Identify facility assets.


Once these assets have been identified, it is important to document them in order to understand their
relationship to the organization (e.g., internal, external), who is responsible for the asset, how well the asset is
protected from disruption, how important the asset is to the critical service, and any changes or updates that
may affect the asset throughout its lifecycle.
This documentation typically includes the following:
• asset type (people, information, technology, or facilities)
• categorization of asset by sensitivity (generally for information assets only)
• asset location (typically where the custodian is managing the asset)
• asset owners and custodians (especially if assets are external to the organization) 
format or form of the asset (particularly for information assets that might exist on paper or electronically)
• location of asset backups or duplicates (particularly for information assets)
• services that are dependent on the asset5
• value of the asset, either qualitative or quantitative
• asset protection and sustainment requirements



Important activities while documenting assets include the following:
• Create an asset inventory.
• Document the relationships between assets and critical services.
• Analyze dependencies between assets supporting multiple services.
• Update the asset inventory.

===================================================================================

Step 1. Obtain support for asset management planning.

Obtaining support from management is essential to ensuring that the asset management plan is effectively
implemented. A top-down approach often helps the asset management program meet the resilience objectives
of the organization. Management can demonstrate support by providing appropriate funding, oversight, and
staffing. A top-down approach also enables a consistent methodology for asset management to be implemented
across organizational boundaries
The level of management support required depends on where assets reside within the organization. For an asset
management plan that addresses the entire organization, support at the senior executive level is necessary.
Smaller implementations, such as those at the service level, may only require sponsorship from the
management responsible for that particular service

Step 2. Identify services.

Identifying assets within an organization can be a daunting task, so the organization should first identify the
services it provides. It can then identify assets by the services they support and divide the body of assets into
manageable pieces

We can distingusih the follwoing type of the asset:

- people People assets are the vital staff who operate and monitor the organization’s services. People who are internal to
the organization (and sometimes people who are external) are in charge of executing processes and procedures
to ensure that the services are achieving the organization’s mission. When identifying people assets, the organization should consider the vital role required for the successful
operation of a service rather than the actual person in that role. It is suggested that each role contain a defined
list of the functions or responsibilities required in the performance of that role

-Information Information assets are any information or data, on any media, required for the successful operation of an
organizational service. An information asset can also be the output or by-product of a service

-Technology Technology assets include software, hardware, firmware, and any physical interconnections. Technology assets
can reside anywhere within an organization, and it is up to the organization to determine how it describes the
technology assets. A good starting point would be at the network-device level, where common network
components such as routers, servers, and switches can be identified. The organization could then move on to
the personal computing devices such as PCs, laptops, and tablets. Identifying broad categories gives the
organization a starting point for uniquely identifying all of the devices within its infrastructure as well as set
boundaries for controls management.

-facilities Facility assets are any physical plant an organization relies on when delivering or performing a service.
Facilities can be owned and controlled by the organization or be under the control of external business
partners

To facilitate the work done during this step of the process, the organization should consider a method of
documentation to keep track of the identified services. This can include documenting in a spreadsheet, a
configuration-controlled document, or a database

Step 3. Prioritize services. 

After the organization has identified all of the services it provides, it should then prioritize those services.
High-value services are services that are critical to the success of the organization’s mission.7 Their failure
may prevent the organization from meeting strategic objectives

The organization must decide how to assign value to its own services. When assigning value and prioritizing
services, the organization should consider the following:
• results from a business impacts analysis (BIA)
• service/business continuity plans
• consequences of risks to services identified during risk assessment activities
• strategic objectives
• presence of the backup
• value fo the asset


Once the organization has prioritized its services, it should document this information in the documentation
tool

By properly prioritizing services, an organization can proportionately allocate budget and resources for
resilience activities with the services that matter most, such as identifying assets.

============================================================================================

The relationships between  individuals and each asset type can be further illustrated using a Responsible,
Accountable, Consulted, Informed (RACI) Matrix; where

Responsible -  role manages the asset on a day-to-day basis

Accountable-  role has to answer to higher level management when issues arise with that asset

Consulted - role has specific knowledge of the asset or relies on that asset and needs to provide input

Invformed - role would need to be updated on the activities surrounding that asset

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Information assets must be carefully mapped to each critical service. This information may include not only
the technical documentation involved in supporting the service, but also the actual information contained
within the database or record structure itself. Information assets to consider also include
• key configuration requirements for supporting systems (e.g., identity and access management permissions,
DNS entries)
• periodic batch processes that must be run to maintain peak performance
• back-up scripts that provide snapshots of the critical information
• proprietary algorithms developed internally that provide unique capability for the organization
• software licensing and purchasing documentation
• vendor support agreements and the people authorized to contact the vendor
• access requirements for each information asset

Data custodian takes a responsibility for the saefty of data that's why 
a data custodian should be assigned to each critical service to ensure this information is appropriately
inventoried, cataloged, and archived in accordance with the organization’s policies and any regulatory or legal
compliance requirements.Information within an organization may be bound by retention requirements that
must be carefully monitored to ensure that only the essential information required for the execution of that 
critical service is maintained for the specified timeline

Keeping too much or too little information introduces
additional risk to the organization that must be avoided. Keeping too much information ties up resources and
adds cost to the overall operation. Keeping too little information may open the organization to a variety of
fines or other punitive measures as spelled out under an applicable regulatory regime.

The data custodian must also ensure that appropriate controls are enacted to protect the information assets of
the critical service. Enterprise- and service-level controls should be defined, implemented, and assessed to
ensure that the appropriate level of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information assets are
maintained.
The organization’s policies should clearly spell out these controls.
At all times, a data custodian should know exactly who has access to the types of information under the
custodian’s purview. This access should be periodically reviewed by internal audit or an independent
organization to ensure compliance with stated policy and with legal and regulatory requirements. All changes
to the access level of an individual must be formally documented and approved.
Organizations should consider implementing access control measures to protect their information assets.
Access control models include
• identity-based access control (IBAC)
• role-based access control (RBAC)
• attribute-based access control (ABAC)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The technology assets should include all components involved in delivering or supporting a critical service,
whether a traditional information technology asset or an operational technology asset. Identifying the systems
on which a critical service relies is essential to understanding the service’s resilience posture

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As the facility assets are identified, the organization should be cognizant of how that facility affects the
services it performs. The organization should prioritize the facilities so that it can focus resources on the
facilities that affect the critical services first. This prioritization should be periodically reviewed and updated
on a schedule determined by the organization
It is essential to identify the primary owner and custodian for the facility assets involved in supporting a
critical service. The responsibility for a facility asset may not fall under a traditional operational department
and may be considered an ancillary service to the organization. In planning for resilience, it is important to
document the facility assets and help highlight their involvement in supporting the critical service. When
designing their services, key stakeholders may not have considered the importance of the infrastructure or
facilities. The organization should ensure that its resilience requirements will be met by any new facilities
