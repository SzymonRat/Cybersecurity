Controls management is an intra-organizational governance process that ensures effective achievement of organizational objectives
and  typically takes place at various levels of an organization
=================================================================================
The cnotrol managemetn docuemnt must have the following

Step 1. Scope statement 

Determines if it's for the entire company or for the particulardepartment
as well as defines what the goal that we are trying to acheive e.g Our goal is to get
a better insight into all data packets that are sent within/in/out of hte company

Scopy: Entire company
Goal: better insight of the data packets

Step 2. Management support/approval

An endorsement by senior management for establishing a controls management program and
implementing processes
Acknowledgement from management fortheintended approachtocontrolsmanagement,
includingstakeholderexpectationsabout acceptable risk tolerance for the identified critical
assets and services

Step 3. List of stakeholders
The list of stakeholders should be aligned tothescopingstatement and include allappropriate
internal and external entities. Potential candidates include
• executive and senior management
• heads of business lines, especially critical services owners
• information technology
• legal
• board of directors
• technology vendors
• regulators and auditors
• compliance personnel

Step 4. List of externally imposed requirements that must be met

Legal and regulatory requirements regarding
cybersecurity, including privacy and civil liberties obligations

Step 5 List of critical asset

Critical asset is an asset that is necessary to the success of the organization’s mission
To ensure operational resilience, an organization should consider each of the four asset types—people,
information, technology, and facilities—when developing control objective

Step 6 .Assignment of responsibilities (mapping asset -> stakeholder)

The relationships between  individuals and each asset type can be further illustrated using a Responsible,
Accountable, Consulted, Informed (RACI) Matrix; where

Responsible -  role manages the asset on a day-to-day basis

Accountable-  role has to answer to higher level management when issues arise with that asset

Consulted - role has specific knowledge of the asset or relies on that asset and needs to provide input

Invformed - role would need to be updated on the activities surrounding that asset


===============================================================
Asset Name e.g| Responsible | Accountable |Consulated |Informed
e.g server IP |             |             |           |
================================================================
VP             | NO          | Yes        | NO        | Yes
===============================================================
CTO            | NO          | YES        | NO        | Yes
==============================================================
Project manager| No          | Yes        | Yes       | Yes
==============================================================
Functional     | Yes         | No         | Yes       | Yes
manager        
==============================================================
Business analys | Yes         | No         | Yes      | Yes
==============================================================
Operational     | Yes         | No         | Yes      | yes
engineer

Step 7 Budget constrains/information

The resources available to an organization for controls
management will influence what controls will be used


Step 8 Choosing the controls that will  help to achieve the company's goals


administrative controls—Administrative controls typically set and enforce management’s policies and
have to be paired with technical and physical controls to be effective. Enterprise-level controls are
often administrative; however, administrative controls can exist at the level of operating units or
individual services. Examples of administrative controls are
o governance
o setting policy
o monitoring
o auditing
o enforcing
o separation of duties
o developing and implementing service continuity plans


technical controls—These controls are operational in nature and primarily executed through
information technology components such as hardware, software, and firmware. Examples of
technical controls are
o network access control
o complex passwords
o error checking
o host-based intrusion detection system
o systems development
o change management
o security
o computer operations19



 physical controls—These are controls for the physical environment and protect people as well as
facilities and the services and technology within. Examples of physical controls are
o guards
o closed circuit television (CCTV)
o biometric access
o temperature and humidity control


Detective controls
o Antivirus
o Event log monitoring
o IPS/IDS

Preventive controls 
o Malware prevention
o Software patching & updates
o User control access
o Network access control
o Encryption

Correective controls - they attempt to reverse the impact of the incident
o rebooting the system
o system backup
o data restoration

An organization can use a single controls development strategy or elements from multiple strategies as
long as the selected approach aligns with the strategic objectives of the organization
Establishing an effective mix of controls should be considered as a way to
keep costs down when developing and evaluating potential control

All controls can be categorized as administrative, technical, or physical:
