Configuration and change management (CCM) is the process of maintaining the integrity of hardware,
software, firmware, and documentation related to the configuration and change management process
CCM is a continuous process of controlling and approving changes to information or technology assets or related
infrastructure that support the critical services of an organization. This process includes the addition of new
assets, changes to assets, and the elimination of assets.

The following terms are associated with the CCM process:
• configuration item (CI)—an asset or series of related assets (typically focused on information or
technology) that is placed under configuration management
• baseline configuration—a representation of the settings, software, and state of a CI, that is formally
reviewed and agreed to at a given point in time and can only be modified through a formal CCM process.
The baseline is used as a reference to manage the integrity of a CI over its lifecycle.

• configuration and change management plan (CCMP)—the process by which changes to CIs are governed
and implementation is executed. This includes policies and processes to request, approve, reject,
implement, monitor, and improve changes to CIs.
• configuration management database (CMDB)—a database used to store configuration records throughout
their lifecycle. A configuration management system maintains one or more configuration databases, and
each database stores attributes of CIs and their relationships with other CIs.4
• configuration control review board (CCRB)—an organizational construct, made up of stakeholders, that is
responsible for supporting the assessment, prioritization, authorization, and scheduling of changes to CIs
and the implementation of policies governing those changes. ITIL refers to this construct as a Change
Advisory Board.

Configuration and Change management plan

CCM enables the organization to control frequent changes to its high-value assets so that disruptions are
mitigated and benefits are optimized. Resilient organizations are able to adapt to or roll back from changes that
do not occur exactly as planned. For CCM, as with many activities, planning greatly impacts the success or
failure of a project.

Configuration Items

A configuration item is any system component, infrastructure component, document, or other item that needs
to be managed to control the introduction of errors into the critical system or service.
The following are the core foundational activities in identifying CIs:
• Map critical organizational services to stakeholders and related services.
• Identify assets related to the critical services.
• Identify the CIs of the assets that will undergo change and require change and configuration management.
• Determine a configuration baseline for each CI


Implement and Control Configuration Changes

Once all of the CIs have been identified and the most current configuration baseline has been tested and
approved, changes can be applied to the systems. Baseline configurations are modified to maintain compliance
with internal and external requirements and organizational goals. For a typical information technology system,
the baseline should address installed software, patch levels, security posture, and system function. Where
possible, the use of automated tools to apply the configurations is recommended. This lowers the risk of
incorrectly applying configurations and provides an audit trail of the steps taken.
The following are the core foundational activities in implementing configurations:
• Evaluate change requests and approvals.
• Model configuration changes in a test environment.
• Deploy changes in the production environment.
• Determine the success or failure of changes.
• Roll back unsuccessful changes.
• Close out completed changes.
• Change configuration baselines. 




Monitor Configuration Changes
Controlling the changes to the baseline configurations of ever-evolving systems represents a major challenge
to organizations. In this phase, organizations ensure that changes are identified, proposed, reviewed, and tested
prior to implementation.
The following are the core foundational activities in monitoring configuration change:
• Identify systems or components not specified in documentation.
• Identify disparities between authorized, approved baselines and actual, implemented baselines.
• Monitor system logs for unauthorized changes.
• Collect existing audits and configuration control records.
• Define remediation action.
• Execute monitoring plan. 

Management support is essential for an effective CCM plan (CCMP). Senior executive (C-level) support is
often necessary for a CCMP being developed for an entire organization. For plans scoped to an individual
service, only sponsorship from senior management responsible for the service may be necessary. For example,
consider a hospital that has the following departments: Emergency Room, Cardiology, Radiology, Laboratory,
Pharmacy, Surgical Services, Orthopedics, Physical Therapy, Information Services, and Materials
Management. Configuration changes may affect each of these critical business functions differently, and largescale changes could impact them all. Senior management needs to balance the responsiveness of CCM
managed at each individual unit against the cost savings that can be achieved by managing it at a higher level


Existing documentation will provide insight into the organization’s unique requirements for implementing
changes. It will also help identify any relevant external requirements, including regulatory boards or entities
that must be considered in the design and implementation of changes. Also gather information collected as part
of any other CRR implementations to reference when developing a CCMP.

The change management request should answer the following questions:
• What business objective does the service support?
• Do other services depend on this service to complete their tasks?
• What is the cost of disruption if the service fails?
• What is the potential punishment (e.g., fines, litigation) for failure of the service?
• Is there a potential for revenue or reputation loss?
• Who is responsible for service (list the person, role, or group)? 



Implementing a CCMP usually entails a change in the fundamental culture of an organization. Determining if
there are gaps in the staff’s relevant knowledge, skills, and abilities and if the organization has appropriate
training will greatly impact the success of the plan. It is also important for an organization to determine if it has
staff qualified to enact the needed changes. Training those responsible for evaluating, approving, initiating, and
monitoring changes is necessary to reduce the probability of executing unsuccessful changes

There are various tools for managing the general CCM process. These tools track the overall process of
configuration changes, including requests, status, communications, and issues related to changes. An
organization should select a tool that meets its particular needs. Configuration information, including
configuration baselines and historical changes to baselines and assets, is often consolidated in a configuration
management database tool. There are also software tools, such as versioning repositories, that help manage
changes in documentation. The CIs subject to the configuration management process, and their associated
software, will often determine the choice of tools.




The modeling and testing of changes is often an overlooked step in the CM process. Ignoring this step leads to
an unusually high occurrence of changes that must be rolled back and a greater number of unsuccessful
changes. Organizations with a mature CCM process have an established modeling and test environment for all
critical systems, and they document the testing of all changes. An adequate modeling and testing environment
should have the following:
• isolated systems whose configurations are identical to the current approved baseline
• data sets that closely mimic those in production (often these are clones of the live data)
o Follow all regulatory requirements when working even with clones of live data.
o Document any access of copies of personally identifiable information (PII), financial information, and
protected health information. 
Use synthetic data as long as it closely mirrors the structure of actual data.
• inter-system connectivity mirroring that of the production environment (networking, ACLs, access
methods)
• access given to system owners and key stakeholders who use the system, but restricted access to all others
• incorporated tools and procedures that test the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the test data
before and after a change is implemented

Schedule configuration changes for deployment into production.
1. Send a general announcement to all staff who have dependencies on the affected system, application,
or documentation.
2. Allow adequate time for information to be disseminated to stakeholders.
3. Verify that downtime procedures are in place for mission-critical services.
4. Preferentially schedule configuration changes during non-peak times.
− Avoid end of month, quarter, or year for financial systems.
− Avoid peak production times for industrial systems.
− Avoid times of high patient volume for health-care systems.
− Avoid critical organizational deadlines or external regulatory audits.
B. Notify key stakeholders immediately prior to the change execution.
1. Prepare on-call or onsite list.
2. Maintain multiple contact avenues for key stakeholders (cell phone, home phone, email, etc.)


To determine if the change was a success or failure we can use the following questions:

• Did the configuration change have the intended impact on the CI?
• Was the change completed within the window allotted to make the change?
• Did the change have to be rolled back due to unidentified issues?
• Did the change have significant, adverse impacts on systems or users not identified prior to the change?
• Did the change have positive or adverse impacts on the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the
data?
• Did the change improve performance of the CI or user experience with the CI?
• Did the communications plan adequately notify stakeholders of the impending change and the progress of
the change?
o This will be largely dependent on the volume of reported issues related to the change.
o This can also be assessed by using a post-change survey of key stakeholders.
