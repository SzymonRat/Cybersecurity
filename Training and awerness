Training and awareness focuses on the processes by which an organization plans, identifies needs for,
conducts, and improves training and awareness to ensure the organization’s operational cyber resilience
requirements and goals are known and used


Important activities while planning for training and awareness include the following:
• Obtain support for training and awareness planning.
• Establish a training and awareness program strategy.
• Establish an approach to building a training capability.
• Establish an approach to building an awareness capability. 

Building capability and conducting training and awareness activities usually involve engaging multiple levels
of the organization as well as third-party providers. Cyber resilience efforts should be incorporated into any
existing training and awareness program and evaluated for effectiveness. Establishing capability for cyber
resilience training and awareness includes identifying and developing the program’s educational vehicles
(courses, presentations, etc.). Each organization will have unique needs for cyber resilience training and
awareness that must be addressed with activities developed specifically for the organization, as well as
common needs that can be met by third-party providers.

Important activities for building capability and conducting training and awareness include the following:
• Establish and maintain support functions for training and awareness (e.g., library for storing materials and
a record tracking system).
• Develop training and awareness materials.
• Procure third-party provider services.
• Conduct training and awareness activities

To be effective, training and awareness activities must be meaningful to both the employee and the
organization. Evaluators must plan ahead to collect sufficient data to examine the effectiveness of the activities
and recommend improvements to be incorporated in the next cycle. The data collected should allow the
analysis of the programs against four desired outcomes:
• Employees are better able to perform their jobs.
• Supervisors are better able to assess changes to their employees’ on-the-job performance.
• The organization feels confident that the employees are performing activities in a way that demonstrates a
resilient organization (e.g., meets the goals and objectives).
• The training and awareness activities can be improved.
Evaluation requires the collection of data and observations throughout the organization’s training cycle.
Evaluation and analysis of training and awareness programs should occur at an organizationally defined 


frequency to support the incorporation of updated material and synchronization with the execution of the
training and awareness plan.
Important activities in the training and awareness assessment process include the following:
• Establish a plan to evaluate the training and awareness program.
• Evaluate the training and awareness program and analyze results.
• Improve the process.
• Update training and awareness materials

Training needs are derived by identifying the skills and knowledge required to perform the necessary work and
comparing them to the current skills and knowledge capabilities of the assigned personnel. Any gaps that
prevent personnel from effectively performing their work are identified as training needs. If the organization
has an established training program, there may already be a needs analysis process in place. Still, the
organization should review the previously identified needs to ensure they include those specific to cyber
resilience.
If the organization does not have a training program, then it should develop an approach for data collection and
analysis. There are many ways to collect the necessary data, for example, document review (e.g., domainrelated plans), surveys, interviews, questionnaires, user observation, workshops, exercises, brain storming, use
cases, prototypes, and role playing. Using a variety of elicitation techniques may facilitate initial needs
assessments. Once the needs are established, a simple review by key stakeholders will ensure that this is still
an accurate picture of the needs.
One approach to identifying training needs specific to cyber resilience is to use domain-related plans (e.g.,
controls management plan, risk management plan). Those plans should include a list of critical skills and
knowledge needed to perform the planned work. Job descriptions also provide information on skills and
knowledge needed to perform a particular job. As the organization assigns roles to staff, it should identify any
gaps in skills and knowledge as training needs. If plans or skills and knowledge information are not available,
it may be necessary to gather training needs through interviews with managers responsible for the different
aspects of the organization’s cyber resilience efforts or from employee training and development plans.
Training needs are documented and accumulated across the organization, providing an overall picture of the
number of people who need training in different skill and knowledge categories.


Unlike skills training, awareness efforts communicate a message to a broad group of employees with different
skills and experience. The awareness message often conveys information about organizational goals,
objectives, and critical success factors. The message can also provide employees with information that
improves operational resilience (e.g., security and confidentiality guidelines, vulnerability and incident
notices). Awareness needs are identified through multiple sources, such as
• resilience requirements
• organizational policies
• vulnerabilities under watch
• laws and regulations 


The organization can use the lists of prioritized training and awareness needs to plan how those needs will be
met. Training can be accomplished through several different approaches, such as
• classroom training
• guided self-study
• on-the-job training
• mentoring programs
In addition to determining the approach to use, the organization needs to decide whether it will acquire the
training through a third-party provider or develop the training itself. Although many training needs can be met
through third-party providers, certain organization-specific training (such as process-related training) should be
developed internally.
Similarly, awareness activities can be accomplished through several different approaches, such as
• poster campaigns
• newsletters
• email messages
• presentations for organization-wide or team meetings
• trainer-facilitated sessions


Training and awareness capabilities must be kept current and up to date; the manner in which the training and
awareness material is delivered must be effective in the eyes of those who are being trained.
The results of a completed evaluation will enable the organization to make informed decisions about
improving the training and awareness plans and strategies. Once the organization has identified the problem
areas, it can begin to identify updates to existing training and awareness activities and propose new activities.
