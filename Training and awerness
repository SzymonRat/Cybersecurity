Training and awareness focuses on the processes by which an organization plans, identifies needs for,
conducts, and improves training and awareness to ensure the organization’s operational cyber resilience
requirements and goals are known and used


Important activities while planning for training and awareness include the following:
• Obtain support for training and awareness planning.
• Establish a training and awareness program strategy.
• Establish an approach to building a training capability.
• Establish an approach to building an awareness capability. 

Building capability and conducting training and awareness activities usually involve engaging multiple levels
of the organization as well as third-party providers. Cyber resilience efforts should be incorporated into any
existing training and awareness program and evaluated for effectiveness. Establishing capability for cyber
resilience training and awareness includes identifying and developing the program’s educational vehicles
(courses, presentations, etc.). Each organization will have unique needs for cyber resilience training and
awareness that must be addressed with activities developed specifically for the organization, as well as
common needs that can be met by third-party providers.

Important activities for building capability and conducting training and awareness include the following:
• Establish and maintain support functions for training and awareness (e.g., library for storing materials and
a record tracking system).
• Develop training and awareness materials.
• Procure third-party provider services.
• Conduct training and awareness activities

To be effective, training and awareness activities must be meaningful to both the employee and the
organization. Evaluators must plan ahead to collect sufficient data to examine the effectiveness of the activities
and recommend improvements to be incorporated in the next cycle. The data collected should allow the
analysis of the programs against four desired outcomes:
• Employees are better able to perform their jobs.
• Supervisors are better able to assess changes to their employees’ on-the-job performance.
• The organization feels confident that the employees are performing activities in a way that demonstrates a
resilient organization (e.g., meets the goals and objectives).
• The training and awareness activities can be improved.
Evaluation requires the collection of data and observations throughout the organization’s training cycle.
Evaluation and analysis of training and awareness programs should occur at an organizationally defined 


frequency to support the incorporation of updated material and synchronization with the execution of the
training and awareness plan.
Important activities in the training and awareness assessment process include the following:
• Establish a plan to evaluate the training and awareness program.
• Evaluate the training and awareness program and analyze results.
• Improve the process.
• Update training and awareness materials
