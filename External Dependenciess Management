The purpose of EDM is to ensure the protection and sustainment of services and assets
that are dependent on the actions of external entities. 
External dependencies and supply chain concerns are not new. Recently, however, advances in information
and communications technology (ICT) have made it possible for businesses to realize great efficiency gains,
cost savings, and flexibility. At the same time, global competitive pressures have driven organizations to take
advantage of these gains through automation and outsourcing. These trends have sometimes outpaced
organizations’ ability to manage the resulting risks, making it a growing priority to establish and manage
appropriate controls to ensure the delivery of critical services dependent on the actions of external entities.
The risk introduced by external dependency is one of the more challenging areas to manage because
organizations have a limited ability to directly monitor and control the vulnerabilities and threats introduced.
Ensuring that external entities are meeting the risk objectives of an organization, across the full range of
resiliency management capabilities, is a broad scope to address. Moreover, managing the overall
organization’s operational risk profile when both the management and status of key external dependencies is
uncertain is a challenge that has become one of the top priorities for organizations, governments, and
regulators.
Like any organization, the external entities that the organization depends on may be susceptible to a diverse
and dynamic array of threats, which can negatively affect the dependent organization’s people, information,
technology, and facility assets and consequently the organization’s ability to meet its objectives . The
key challenge for many organizations is their limited ability to ensure the resilience of the external entities they
rely on. 
External suppliers or entities supporting organizations fall into three general relationship categories:
Vendor—Entities are chosen by the organization and are typically governed by negotiated agreements. Examples include
providers of raw materials, labor, consulting, maintenance, hardware/software, and facilities.
Shared infrastructure—The supplier provides its services to a region or group. Agreements are usually standardized and
are virtually the same across the customer base. Examples include power, water, and telecommunications.
Public—Typically these relationships are with a government entity such as a state, local, or federal agency and are not
governed by a contract or agreement. Examples include security services (fire, police) and transportation networks.

Monitoring, governing, and correcting supplier performance are essential activities. As with all aspects of
dependency management the approach must be risk-based, reflecting the supplier’s importance and the
potential impact of its failure to meet the organization’s requirements. When appropriate, the organization may
take corrective actions such as imposing fines, transitioning to another vendor, or bringing the activity back
into the organization. The organization might also mitigate risk through other means, such as adding suppliers
or strengthening its service continuity and incident management plans. 


Monitoring and improving the EDM processes and program help ensure that they continue to support the
organization’s objectives. This phase of the process focuses on maintaining the effectiveness of dependency
and risk management, and involves assessing the effectiveness of EDM and any needed refinements to the
plan.

Management support in an EDM plan is normally documented as a policy statement and preface to the plan
which explains the emphasis and importance that executive leadership places on external dependency
management. After management support is obtained, there are four primary inputs needed to develop a strategy
for EDM:
• scope
• objectives
• enterprise requirements
• risk management planning 


The organization and the plan writers should identify the objectives of the EDM plan. Normally, a basic
objective is to ensure the resilience of the high-value service. Writing an objective statement, such as “The
objective of the External Dependencies Management Plan is to effectively manage external dependencies risks
in a cost-efficient manner and protect [high-value service] for the benefit of our organization and
stakeholders,” is a clear and useful first step

Next the organization should document any enterprise requirements that will apply to all external
dependencies. These may be based on a broad range of factors, business judgments, and inputs from other
resilience processes (controls management, technology management, incident management, service continuity,
and others). Enterprise requirements might include
• satisfaction of compliance obligations that extend to third-party entities (HIPAA business associate
requirements are a common example from the health-care sector)
• maintenance of service continuity and incident management plans
• a level of financial stability desired in any external entity that supports the critical service

Finally, as part of the EDM strategy, the organization should document specifically how it will manage the
risks of entering into and maintaining relationships with external entities. This part of the strategy should
document the role of organizational risk managers in the external dependency management process and clarify
the risk management responsibilities of the various parties or organizational components involved. In most
cases managers who interface with external entities, typically in the areas of business operations, procurement,
and IT operations, should work closely with enterprise-level risk managers to inform them and help make
decisions.


Forming relationships with suppliers sets a course for managing dependency risks over the lifecycle of the
relationships. The quality of communications and collaboration can drive the management of external
dependencies risk and establish effective support for the organization over the long term. Done well,
collaborative relationships can spur efficiencies, information sharing, innovation, and growth. To make this a
reality, the organization should carefully plan and document how it will form new relationships with external
entities.

The plan should also specify how the organization will ensure that the correct requirements are developed for
each external entity. Though enterprise requirements (discussed previously) are a very important part of the
agreements between the organization and the external entity they usually form only part of the requirements
for a particular external entity. The full set of requirements will be based on the specific service or support
provided by the external entity and its role in support of the critical service or services that the organization
provides to its own stakeholders. The following is an example list of requirements:
• resilience capabilities or level of cybersecurity maturity
• operational and technology availability and history/capability
• financial viability
• use and oversight of subcontractors
• disruption management capabilities (e.g., incident management and business continuity)
• environment factors (geographic, political, or weather event exposures)
• infrastructure exposures or risks
• cybersecurity threat and vulnerability management


The plan should document how the organization will evaluate and confirm that the candidate external entity
can actually meet the requirements. Normally the particular steps or measures to do so will vary according to
the risk level presented by the proposed relationship. Some example methods for evaluating the capability of
external entities include
• third-party audit or assessment (process maturity or penetration testing)
• completion of standard checklists
• research on the external entity, for example, customer references
• direct examination of artifacts (e.g., the entity’s incident response plan )


Organizations increasingly rely on external entities for information and communications technology services,
often to interact with assets that are essential to achieving the organizational mission. The organization should
document a process for how it will reliably and sustainably identify existing external dependencies. This part
of the plan should contain two sections:
• a statement about how the organization will approach dependency identification
• the staff roles that will be directly responsible for ensuring that the list of external dependencies is
populated and updated
The Cyber Resilience Review’s focus on services and assets and its underlying approach provide a framework
for identifying external dependencies. By first understanding the organizational assets that most closely
support the high-value services, managers can then identify those assets’ related external dependencies. For
example, an organization that depends on access to its customer data—a particular type of information asset—
might focus on managing external dependencies associated with the data’s custodianship, maintenance,
protection, and support; raising the priority of the current controls and mitigations to prevent a data breach;
ensuring the availability of the data; and mitigating data center outages or failures of the networks used to
access the data

The plan should next document the staff positions and roles that will help the responsible manager identify
dependencies. Leveraging existing processes and communications channels where possible facilitates a
smoother transition to a new or improved external dependency identification approach. For example, business
continuity planners collect information on suppliers, contract groups are involved in managing existing
suppliers and typically know which are key to the business, and senior executives have insight into long-term
strategies in which suppliers play leading roles. Internal service or product line owners will also normally have
a good sense of their dependencies. The following are some typical data sources and artifacts for dependency
and supplier information:
• contracts and supplier agreements
• supplier and customer databases
• asset management database
• business continuity plans

Organizations should next plan how to determine and rank the priority and importance of their external
dependencies. The organization should use a risk-based approach that focuses resources on managing only
those external entities that most directly impact essential services. For example, suppliers providing facilities
maintenance may require less attention because they typically have minimal impact on service delivery and
can be easily replaced should they fail to perform as expected. The prioritization process should be
documented and typically includes the following steps:
1. Determine and standardize the prioritization criteria used to distinguish the relative importance of each
dependency or external entity.
2. Establish thresholds for dependency grouping (e.g., Tier 1, Tier 2), for controls management and
oversight.
3. Document the frequency of follow-up priority reviews.

Criteria to consider when prioritizing external dependencies include
• the dependencies that support the most important assets (including technology, people, facilities, and
information)
• the criticality of external entities to the essential service(s) or to assets that support the essential service(s)
• the sensitivity of the information the external entity manages or has access to (e.g., secret, confidential,
personal)
• the availability of alternative suppliers or sources of services and products
• support of multiple services provided by single external entities
• external entity’s role in supporting a key service
• reliance on the external entity to ensure and control the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of highvalue assets
• the extent to which the organization would rely on the external entity during a disruption or crisis
These are examples of approaches to criteria that an organization could take to prioritizing external
dependencies. All of them may apply and be useful in the organization or managers may decide that
dependencies should be prioritized using only one or two defined criteria. Regardless of the actual criteria
chosen the prioritization of external dependencies should reflect and be based on the prioritization of services
and assets


Planning and documenting requirements and roles for the management of external entities are essential parts of
the external dependency management plan because external entities are often an extension of the organization
itself. In addition, because of the dependence that many organizations have on external entities and the
complexity of many business structures, external entity considerations may affect the planning of other
resilience processes, for example
• change management and control—collaborating and working with the organization’s change management
process
• planning service continuity and incident management to account for external dependencies
• information management controls—protecting the organization’s information and intellectual property in a
manner that is consistent with its confidentiality and sensitivity
• human resources—reporting HR issues that might affect the organization or its services
• communication and notification—reporting incidents, events, or issues that originate with external entities
and may affect the organization
• service continuity and incident management—understanding the organization’s reliance on external
entities such that it can be accounted for when planning against disruptions
• situational awareness and threat management—identifying and disseminating information about threats
that may originate from or affect external dependencies 

Reporting from a managed repository can help keep external dependencies information accurate and complete.
An EDM repository typically includes information such as
• type of dependency (e.g., data processing, power, software support, situational awareness information)
• name, location, and contacts for external service providers
• services and assets supported
• financial information on agreements and suppliers
• resilience requirements (i.e., confidentiality, integrity, availability)
• criticality or ranking of the external entity (e.g., high, medium, low)
• contract information (e.g., term, contract contact, key contractual obligations, or SLAs)
• documentation on known issues, performance, or compliance concerns
• technical overview (e.g., systems, networks, and information/data managed)
• internal owner of the relationship
The external dependency information management process depends on the clear assignment of ownership.
Accountability and responsibility for the overall information management process might best be assigned to
the individual or group responsible for the overall external dependency program. The more granular level of
information management—the collection, reporting, and maintenance of dependency information for each
relationship—is also critical to the management information process and typically falls to the owner of the
supplier relationship. For relationships whose internal ownership is not easily defined, such as with
government, emergency responders, and critical infrastructure providers, information management
responsibility may need to be assigned by those responsible for the broader EDM program.

Provided that requirements are clear and defined in formal agreements and contracts, organizations can use
these formal agreements to allocate risk to and drive the behavior of contracted parties. Organizations with
greater control over a critical supplier can include extensive control requirements in their agreement along with
monitoring, auditing, and reporting activities to oversee the relationship. Corrective actions or financial
penalties are valuable tools for encouraging an external supplier to expeditiously address its issues,
weaknesses, and risks. Organizations with less control over the supplier (e.g., utility companies and
government agencies) should address missing or weak requirements as risks to be managed internally.
Contractual terms usually include
• nature and scope of relationship or agreement
• cost and payment definition
• SLAs
• metrics and benchmarks to measure performance
• information management requirements
• subcontractor terms and requirements
• compliance requirements
• audit or oversight rights and provisions
• intellectual property and licensing terms
• liability and dispute resolution
• cybersecurity control requirements
• business continuity requirements
• insurance and indemnification
• termination process


From a resilience perspective, formal agreements should also include performance standards and the ability to
modify or change specifications and standards over the life of the agreement. Performance standards should be
included so that the external entity knows how it will be evaluated relative to satisfaction of the contract.
Including language that allows terms and specifications to be updated is very important because the resilience
requirements that apply to the external entity may change and require modification over time. The appropriate
organizational staff should be involved so that the terms and specifications of these formal agreements can be
as effective as possible. Individuals most familiar with the resilience requirements and specific technological
requirements of the high-value services being supported must be directly engaged in contract negotiation.
These personnel should actively communicate with the legal and procurement departments and have a stake in
the process of formalizing relationships.


Identifying and prioritizing dependencies are essential management activities that help the organization
determine the
• dependency exposures that should receive the most attention
• type and extent of controls to be put in place
• extent of resource investments needed to manage associated risks
