The Vulnerability Management domain focuses on the process by which organizations identify, analyze, and
manage vulnerabilities in a critical service’s operating environment.
Vulnerability management is a key component in planning for and determining the appropriate implementation
of controls and the management of risk. It is reasonable to say that vulnerability management is central to
cyber resilience.

The following are the foundational steps in the implementation of the vulnerability management plan:
• Provide training.
• Conduct vulnerability assessment activities.
• Record discovered vulnerabilities.
• Categorize and prioritize vulnerabilities.
• Manage exposure to discovered vulnerabilities.
• Determine effectiveness of vulnerability dispositions.
• Analyze root causes

Vulnerability management requires an organization to understand and assess two specific capabilities: the
discovery of vulnerabilities and the analysis of pertinent vulnerabilities. The discovery capability requires the
expertise to assess the assets and associated processes of the critical services. The organization must also make
sure that the discovery capability covers an appropriately comprehensive portion of the organization. Analysis
is the ability to determine the extent of the vulnerability and its anticipated effect on the organization and its
critical services. Assessing the overall vulnerability management capability ensures that both analysis and
discovery are meeting the organization’s needs.

Mitigations and resolutions against cyber vulnerabilities may also require non-cyber solutions.
These types of vulnerabilities include unsecured server rooms, flooding, work capacity of the personnel, and
other vulnerabilities not specific to the cyber operations of the system and related services.


A. Document the candidate assets and services to be assessed and monitored. In this activity, the
organization is primarily focused on documenting all possible candidates for assessment. Resource
constraints will impact the assessment and monitoring that the organization will actually be able to
accomplish, which will be determined in later steps. Stakeholder should be solicited for their input
concerning their critical services and areas of concern.
• Are all stakeholder assets and services represented?
• Define the criticality of stakeholder assets and services.


B. Determine the operational environment for analysis and monitoring. The operational environment
defines the types of exposure experienced by assets being monitored. Exposures are descriptions of threats
posed by the asset or threats to the organization as a result of a vulnerability in that asset. The environment
should be defined by those exposures to the threats of greatest concern.
• Detail both cyber and non-cyber vulnerabilities.
o Can the asset be affected by physical or cyber threats?
o Will those threats affect the asset’s function or role in cyber resilience?
• Obtain stakeholder input concerning vulnerabilities in the operational environment of their services
and assets
• Obtain third-party threat assessment as needed. The organization may not have the expertise to
address all aspects of its operational environment. 

C. Determine the methods required by regulation. The organization is likely to be bound by industry
regulation. Review the requirements of the related regulations such as the Payment Card Industry (PCI)
Data Security Standard (DSS) or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Some
regulations, such as the PCI DSS, require vulnerability assessments by approved vendors. The
vulnerability analysis and resolution plan should account for the requirements of the regulation.

D. Determine the methods required to meet the operational requirements. Methods must address the
vulnerabilities, services, and assets of concern as determined by the scope of the vulnerability assessment
. The organization should ask the following:
• Do the candidate methods produce information on vulnerabilities within scope?
• Do chosen methods enable the discovery of unanticipated vulnerabilities?
If the methodology focuses on the impact to the service, a detailed decomposition of the assets supporting
the service will highlight what each asset provides the service. With this information and input from the
stakeholders, the organization increases the likelihood of discovering and better prioritizing events that
could impact the service.


E. Determine the legal implications.
• What are the legal requirements to enable the organization to employ the determined methods?
• What are the legal requirements to enable third parties to employ the determined methods?


F. Determine the impact imposed by candidate methods. Certain methods may impose untenable
operational impact. Vulnerability discovery methods could cause system down time or negatively impact
the job performance of personnel.
• Define methods restricted by legal constraints.
• Define methods restricted by operational constraints.
• Define the choice of methods according to determined restrictions.


G. Choose the methods to be employed. After determining the criteria, the organization should be left with
a choice of methods that meet the operational requirement, operational performance constraints, legal
responsibility, and impact.

H.Determien test tools used during the chosen assessment method

J. Remediation time frame



With the list of unique assets to be monitored in hand, the
organization must identify the sources of vulnerability information for each asset
While external sources can provide information on vulnerabilities inherent in a particular asset, they cannot
reveal vulnerabilities that are caused by misconfiguration of a technology asset or a failure in training of
people assets. The organization may decide to use tools to identify these weaknesses. For instance, a
vulnerability scanner or a penetration test may be run periodically against technology assets. Likewise, to
assess training issues, the organization can periodically send fake phishing emails to employees to see who
clicks on them.
Some sources of vulnerability information may be internal to the organization. Managers and human resources
staff may observe abnormal behavior in other employees that could indicate malicious actions. Periodic
background checks of employees may be another source of information.
For facility assets, the organization should consider other sources of information, such as weather forecasts, on
events that could impact the on-site operations.




Any good plan needs to change as the environment around it changes. Organizations should review their
vulnerability management plan at least annually to determine if it is meeting the organization’s needs.
A. Determine if changes have occurred. To determine if the plan needs to be updated, review what has
happened to the organization since the last plan review. Some questions to consider:
• Has new technology been introduced to the organization?
• Have new facilities been added or removed from the organization?
• Has the organization acquired any other organizations?
• Have any components of the organization been divested from the organization?
• Have new methodologies been introduced to detect vulnerabilities?
• Have new people been added, removed, or outsourced?
A yes answer to any of these questions indicates that a more in-depth review of the plan is warranted.
B. Review the changes. Determine the impact of the change to the organization, and make the appropriate
changes to the plan.
C. Update toolset if necessary. The change in the plan may require an update in the tools used to detect
vulnerabilities.
D. Update sources of vulnerability information. If a change has introduced something new (facilities,
technology, etc.) to the organization, it is imperative that the organization identify a source of vulnerability
information for the new asset. Most likely, a relationship with the new asset’s vendor would have been
recently established, and the vendor would be the primary source of information. However, the
organization may want to consider other sources such as user groups. Additionally, if any of the current
sources of information tailor what they send based on a profile, it should also be updated.



Vulnerabilities must be recorded in a vulnerability repository. This enables organizations to approach
vulnerability management in a structured and trackable way. Discovered vulnerabilities are not only useful for
hardening the organization’s current posture but also for planning organizational changes to operations.
Historical data, including data on vulnerabilities, can be a deciding factor in the implementation of an
architecture change.
A. Log the vulnerability into the repository. To ensure that the vulnerability is tracked to closure, it should
be logged into a repository. Some fields that the organization may want to record in the repository are
• discovery date and time
• affected assets
• priority
• categorization
• source
• owner
• analysis notes
• current status
• closure date and time


Assure access control of the repository. Remember that this information is highly sensitive: it is
basically a road map of the organization’s exposures. Treat this information appropriately. Limit access to
the repository to those who have a need to know this information: primarily the vulnerability management
team and its management but possibly personnel from the risk management team as well. 



Now that the organization has determined that the vulnerability is relevant and assigned it a priority rating, it
takes action to reduce its exposure. Common risk dispositions are to accept, avoid, mitigate, or transfer
operational risk.
A. Determine disposition methodology. The disposition action varies based on the nature of the asset and
the source of the vulnerability information.
• Acquire vendor-provided solution. When vendors are made aware of a vulnerability in their product,
they will make changes to eliminate the vulnerability. For information technology systems, these
changes are called patches.
• Change configuration. In some cases, the corrective actions might be to change the configuration of
the asset to eliminate the vulnerability. If a network security scan reveals an unused service, the 
solution might be to turn the service off. For a physical access vulnerability, changing how someone
reaches the asset might be the solution.
• Apply workaround. If there is no patch or configuration options that would remove the vulnerability,
another method to reduce the risk is to place controls in the environment that can prevent the
vulnerability from being exploited.
• Accept the risk. If there is no practical or cost effective method of mitigating at least part of the risk of
the vulnerability, the risk management process should be invoked to define the risk and gain
acceptance for leaving it open.
B. Test disposition. The organization should test the selected disposition prior to general deployment to
determine its impact on the operational environment. This is especially true for technology solutions, but it
also applies to any change. For instance, erecting an entry control gate for the parking lot may
inadvertently cause cars to be backed up into the roadway. In many cases, the change management process
will mandate this step.
C. Deploy disposition method. The tested disposition method should now be deployed into the environment
using the targeted time frames for the priority of the vulnerability. Use of the change management system
is encouraged to allow for the scheduling and approvals needed to make the change. In some cases, the
teams performing the disposition may be different from the team managing the vulnerability. For instance,
patching Windows vulnerabilities might be performed by the server and workstation teams, but managing
the vulnerability might be performed by the information security team.
D. Track to resolution. All corrective actions should be tracked in the vulnerability management repository
until the selected disposition methodology has been applied for the vulnerability throughout the
organization’s environment. If a disposition deployment is delayed and is going to miss the vulnerability’s
targeted time frame for resolution, the exception process developed in conjunction with the plan should be
invoked. The organizations should note any abnormal effects caused by the disposition, along with their
resolution, in the repository. If the organization uses a change management tool, each of its entries should
refer to the corresponding entry in the vulnerability repository, and vice versa. This will facilitate the next
step.
If the disposition activity is just a workaround, the organization should continue to monitor for the
availability of a vendor-provided solution. When one is available, this “Manage exposure to discovered
vulnerabilities” step should be repeated in its entirety.
