The Vulnerability Management domain focuses on the process by which organizations identify, analyze, and
manage vulnerabilities in a critical service’s operating environment.
Vulnerability management is a key component in planning for and determining the appropriate implementation
of controls and the management of risk. It is reasonable to say that vulnerability management is central to
cyber resilience.

The following are the foundational steps in the implementation of the vulnerability management plan:
• Provide training.
• Conduct vulnerability assessment activities.
• Record discovered vulnerabilities.
• Categorize and prioritize vulnerabilities.
• Manage exposure to discovered vulnerabilities.
• Determine effectiveness of vulnerability dispositions.
• Analyze root causes

Vulnerability management requires an organization to understand and assess two specific capabilities: the
discovery of vulnerabilities and the analysis of pertinent vulnerabilities. The discovery capability requires the
expertise to assess the assets and associated processes of the critical services. The organization must also make
sure that the discovery capability covers an appropriately comprehensive portion of the organization. Analysis
is the ability to determine the extent of the vulnerability and its anticipated effect on the organization and its
critical services. Assessing the overall vulnerability management capability ensures that both analysis and
discovery are meeting the organization’s needs.

Mitigations and resolutions against cyber vulnerabilities may also require non-cyber solutions.
These types of vulnerabilities include unsecured server rooms, flooding, work capacity of the personnel, and
other vulnerabilities not specific to the cyber operations of the system and related services.


A. Document the candidate assets and services to be assessed and monitored. In this activity, the
organization is primarily focused on documenting all possible candidates for assessment. Resource
constraints will impact the assessment and monitoring that the organization will actually be able to
accomplish, which will be determined in later steps. Stakeholder should be solicited for their input
concerning their critical services and areas of concern.
• Are all stakeholder assets and services represented?
• Define the criticality of stakeholder assets and services.


B. Determine the operational environment for analysis and monitoring. The operational environment
defines the types of exposure experienced by assets being monitored. Exposures are descriptions of threats
posed by the asset or threats to the organization as a result of a vulnerability in that asset. The environment
should be defined by those exposures to the threats of greatest concern.
• Detail both cyber and non-cyber vulnerabilities.
o Can the asset be affected by physical or cyber threats?
o Will those threats affect the asset’s function or role in cyber resilience?
• Obtain stakeholder input concerning vulnerabilities in the operational environment of their services
and assets.
• Obtain third-party threat assessment as needed. The organization may not have the expertise to
address all aspects of its operational environment. 

C. Determine the methods required by regulation. The organization is likely to be bound by industry
regulation. Review the requirements of the related regulations such as the Payment Card Industry (PCI)
Data Security Standard (DSS) or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Some
regulations, such as the PCI DSS, require vulnerability assessments by approved vendors. The
vulnerability analysis and resolution plan should account for the requirements of the regulation.

D. Determine the methods required to meet the operational requirements. Methods must address the
vulnerabilities, services, and assets of concern as determined by the scope of the vulnerability assessment
(established in Step 1). The organization should ask the following:
• Do the candidate methods produce information on vulnerabilities within scope?
• Do chosen methods enable the discovery of unanticipated vulnerabilities?
If the methodology focuses on the impact to the service, a detailed decomposition of the assets supporting
the service will highlight what each asset provides the service. With this information and input from the
stakeholders, the organization increases the likelihood of discovering and better prioritizing events that
could impact the service.


E. Determine the legal implications.
• What are the legal requirements to enable the organization to employ the determined methods?
• What are the legal requirements to enable third parties to employ the determined methods?


F. Determine the impact imposed by candidate methods. Certain methods may impose untenable
operational impact. Vulnerability discovery methods could cause system down time or negatively impact
the job performance of personnel.
• Define methods restricted by legal constraints.
• Define methods restricted by operational constraints.
• Define the choice of methods according to determined restrictions.


G. Choose the methods to be employed. After determining the criteria, the organization should be left with
a choice of methods that meet the operational requirement, operational performance constraints, legal
responsibility, and impact.
